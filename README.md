# Visualyze

### Brining Visual AI to the Masses

The word Visualyze comes from the words "Visual" and "Analyze". It is our goal to help make Visual Analysis both extremely easy and accessible. Visualyze extracts 3D meshes from a 2D video and lets the user choose their preferred viewing configuration.

For example, in choreographed activities such as dance, it allows each and every one to learn better and faster than ever before. All it takes is for 1 member to videotape a dance on a regular old cellphone and upload it to the Visualyze website. The website will then process the video by figuring how many people are in it, then by creating meshes for everyone. This way, there is a wide overview for anyone who wants it, but most importantly it allows performer to ignore other distracting parts.

While this technology isn't exactly new, it is the accessibility and the ease of use that will propel Visualyze to the front of any industry that relies upon learning and repeating a physical movement.

Another big field Visualyze can get into is sports. For sports like basketball and swimming, it's almost just a game of "imitate the best player". Just trying to imitate them from a 2D video doesn't work the best; it's almost impossible to be at every Raptors game ever, and even more impossible to have a good view every time. With Visualyze, you are able to take that 2D footage and constantly analyze it at your discretion. Confused on how he managed to jump that high? All it takes is the 3D mesh animation, so that you are able to see a heatmap of which parts of the body are moving at what speed.

There are countless other industries ready to be innovavated with just a few pushes of a button. Confused on which ones? Just Visualyze it.
